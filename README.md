# getris - a bad tetris clone

mainly created due to boredom and wanting to check out SDL2 while branching my go skills out

currently in development, this does **not** fully work!

the fonts are licensed under the OFL and were *not* made by me, though mostly everything else was and is licensed under MPL-2

#### [downloads](github.com/thaYt/getris/releases)

---

# make
#### linux
do `make` to build or `make run` to run

#### others
for windows and macos, good luck! ‚ù§

(please don't sue me tetris company)
